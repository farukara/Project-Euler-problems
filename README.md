## [001 - Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/001%20-%20Multiples%20of%203%20and%205.py)

[Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. **Answer:** 233,168

## [002 - Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/002%20-%20Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers.py)

[Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. **Answer:** 4,613,732

**<u>Solution and Notes:</u>** There are a couple of approaches to this problem.

1. Naive recursive algorithm (takes exponential time): just finding and adding each number recursively.
2. Memoization approach (linear time)There is a general approach to make this kind of bad algorithms good that's called 'memoization'(Memoized Dynamic Programinf Algorithm) Check [MIT opencourse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M) for more detailed explaination. This takes a linear time because each Fibonacci is called just once.
3. Bottom-up Approach(cost same time as memoization): It's similar approach exccept that it starts from bottom, i.e.Fib[1] and makes it's way up. It's advantage is it saves space because we only need 2 most recent items in the dictionary.Furthermore, linear time use is more obvious in this approach than the memoization.
4. TODO There is even better algorithms which makes time used logarithmic.

## [003 - Largest prime factor](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/003%20-%20Largest%20prime%20factor.py)

[Problem 3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)

**TODO:** Takes a long time to spit out the answer. Try to find a better algorithm.

**TODO:** Add a if function to the beginnig to check if the given number is prime itself.

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

**Answer:**

## [004 - Largest palindrome product](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/004%20-%20Largest%20palindrome%20product.py)

[Problem 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

**Answer:** 994 x 583

## [005 - Smallest multiple](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/005%20-%20Smallest%20multiple.py)

[Problem 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20

**Answer:** 232792560

## [006 - Sum square difference](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/006%20-%20Sum%20square%20difference.py)

[Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

**Answer:** 25164150

## 007 - 10001st prime

[Problem 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

**Answer:** 104743 

**<u>Solution and Notes:</u>** 
4 different approaches used(from fast to slow):

1. Python's sympy module. Pretty fast.
2. TODO Using math tricks:
3. Using just sqrt from math module and own writen isprime function: Takes about 2 sec. Instead of checking till n, we can check till √n because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of smaller factor that has been already checked.
4. Naive brute force using own written "isprime" function. Takes about 2-3 minutes to compute.

## 008 - Largest product in a series 

[Problem 8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)

The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.
