## [001 - Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/001%20-%20Multiples%20of%203%20and%205.py)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
**Answer:** 233,168

## [002 - Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/002%20-%20Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers.py)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
**Answer:** 4,613,732

## [003 - Largest prime factor]
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
