## [001 - Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/001%20-%20Multiples%20of%203%20and%205.py)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
**Answer:** 233,168

## [002 - Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/002%20-%20Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers.py)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
**Answer:** 4,613,732

## [003 - Largest prime factor](https://github.com/farukara/Project-Euler-problems/blob/master/files/003%20-%20Largest%20prime%20factor.py)

**TODO:** Takes a long time to spit out the answer. Try to find a better algorithm.

**TODO:** Add a if function to the beginnig to check if the given number is prime itself.

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

**Answer:** 

## [004 - Largest palindrome product]

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

**Answer:** 994 x 583
